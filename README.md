## Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features

**Recipedia** is your go-to destination for discovering and experimenting with a wide variety of recipes right from home. I built a robust and intuitive interface that allows users to easily browse and navigate through recipes. You can quickly scroll through different options, tap on a recipe to view its details, or search by recipe name or cuisine. Filtering by cuisine is also supported for faster access.

Customization features include the ability to toggle between system, light, and dark appearance modes, as well as switch between single-column and multi-column layouts for recipe viewing.

### Screenshots:

#### Main app functionality:

| Recipes View | Recipe View | Pull to Refresh | Empty Data | Malformed Data | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src=Assets/RecipesView.png width="250"> | <img src=Assets/RecipeView.png width="250"> | <img src=Assets/PulltoRefresh.png width="250"> | <img src=Assets/EmptyData.png width="250"> | <img src=Assets/MalformedData.png width="250"> |

- **Recipes View:** Allows you to view all of the recipes retrived from the network.
- **Recipe View:** Allows you to view the information of the selected recipe and link out to its instructions and video walkthrough.

#### Added functionality and design:

| Search | Filter | Single Column | Appearance |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src=Assets/Search.png width="250"> | <img src=Assets/Filter.png width="250"> | <img src=Assets/SingleColumn.png width="250"> | <img src=Assets/Appearance.png width="250"> |

- **Search:** Allows you to search on name and cuisine of recipes.
- **Filter:** Allows you to quickly filter on the cuisine of a recipe (can be paired with searching by recipe name).
- **Single Column:** Allows you to view recipes in a single column making it easier to read and view recipe information.
- **Appearance:** Allows you to select the appearance mode for your app (system, light, dark). I really enjoy the appearance of apps, in particular dark mode, and so I wanted to give that same ability here.
